# ly-820-pwm
PWM Addon card for LY-820 PWM DC Motor driver

This card replaces the chip of the LY-820 PWM Board and moves it up to the addon card, enabling both spindle on (Deadtime 100% when no signal) and PWM Input for motor speed control, adjustable by pot on the card.

Designed for +5V signals.

Supposed to be used _without_ the potentiometer connected to LY-820 board.
